# FPGA Object Detection with YOLOv5

This repository provides an FPGA-based solution for executing object detection, focusing specifically on the popular YOLOv5 model architecture. By leveraging the power of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and utilizing the [**fpgaConvNet**](https://github.com/AlexMontgomerie/fpgaconvnet-model) framework and the [**Xilinx PYNQ**](http://www.pynq.io/) library, this solution enables high-performance and efficient execution of object detection tasks.
